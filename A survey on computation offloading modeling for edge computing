主题：边缘计算中的计算分流问题
结构：
1、对前人提出的边缘计算结构进行分类
2、对 channel model, computation and communication model, and energy harvesting model等主流的计算分流模型，
并通过 (non-)convex optimization, Markov decision process, game theory, Lyapunov optimization,
or machine learning对每种模型进行分析

核心内容：
1、Computation offloading, which offloads computation tasks to EC,
  consists of a transmission procedure, a remote execution procedure, and
  a result send-back procedure

2、offloading scheme：
    a.Task partition: If a task is partitionable, we need to optimally
      partition the task before offloading (Fig. 1b). Otherwise, the whole
      task should be offloaded to an EC server .
    b.Offloading decision (task placement): to decide which EC server(s)
      will execute the whole task or the partitioned task. It is worth noting
      that the task can also be executed locally.
    c.Resource allocation: to determine the amount of resources needed.
      These resources include computing resources, communication resources, and energy which should be allocated for the tasks or
      components. 
      导出问题的核心在于以上三个步骤的最优化
      
3、主流Edge computing architectures and frameworks ：
    a.European Telecommunications Standards Institute
      (ETSI) MEC, 
    b.OpenFog
    c.mobile Edge computing for the Internet of Things
      (EdgeIoT)
    d.FLexible Edge Computing (FLEC)
    分类：two-tier(2级构架)/three-tier(3级构架)
    The two-tier architecture (ED-EC) enables EC alone to handle computation
    tasks while in the three-tier architecture (ED-EC-Cloud) EC works as a
    complement to cloud computing.
